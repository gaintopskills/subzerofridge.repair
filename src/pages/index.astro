         <p>Your Sub-Zero refrigerator is a premium appliance, but like any complex device, it may encounter issues. Knowing when to call a technician is crucial to ensure the longevity and optimal performance of your appliance. Here are common problems to watch for:</p>

    <h2>1. Temperature Inconsistencies:</h2>
    <p>If you notice uneven cooling in the refrigerator or freezer compartments, it may indicate issues with the thermostat, sensors, or condenser. Call a technician if temperature problems persist.</p>

    <h2>2. Ice Maker Malfunctions:</h2>
    <p>Problems with ice production, irregular ice shapes, or issues with the ice dispenser may require professional attention. Technicians can diagnose and repair the ice maker components effectively.</p>

    <h2>3. Water Leaks:</h2>
    <p>Water pooling inside or around the refrigerator could signal problems with the defrost system, water inlet valve, or clogged drain. A technician can identify and address the root cause of the leakage.</p>

    <h2>4. Unusual Noises:</h2>
    <p>If your Sub-Zero fridge starts making unfamiliar sounds like buzzing, clicking, or rattling, it could indicate issues with the compressor, fan motors, or other internal components. Professional diagnosis is recommended.</p>

    <h2>5. Faulty Seals:</h2>
    <p>A compromised door gasket can impact the efficiency of your refrigerator. If you observe visible damage or feel cool air escaping, a technician can replace the door seal promptly.</p>

    <h2>6. Condenser Coil Issues:</h2>
    <p>Dust and debris accumulation on condenser coils can hinder cooling efficiency. A technician can clean the coils to enhance the overall performance of your Sub-Zero fridge.</p>

    <h2>When to Call a Technician:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Persistent Issues:** If problems persist despite basic troubleshooting, it's time to seek professional help.</li>
        <li>**Specialized Components:** Sub-Zero appliances have intricate components; for issues related to these, a technician's expertise is essential.</li>
        <li>**Preserving Warranty:** If your refrigerator is under warranty, calling a certified technician ensures repairs are covered and performed to manufacturer standards.</li>
        <li>**Safety Concerns:** If you notice any issues that may pose safety risks, such as strange odors or smoke, contact a technician immediately.</li>
